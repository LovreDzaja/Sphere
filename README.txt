# Sphere

Hello everyone and welcome!

This is a project of mine where I show my skills while using technologies like HTML,CSS,JavaScript,Vite.js, Three.js and gsap to achieve animations.
This is just a Sphere as title says that rotates and switches colors based on users x and y axis. 

Just reminder in case you can't run the project. 

You need to install npm package named Vite.js , Three.js and gsap.

These are the commands for npm:

npm install vite

npm install three

npm install gsap


Thanks for visiting, I hope you love it!
